Canteen Automation System
Canteen Automation System,is a system for ordering foods online.The main advantage of this system is that it greatly simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the canteen. When the customer visits the ordering webpage, they are presented with an interactive and up-to-date menu, complete with all available options and dynamically adjusting prices based on the selected options.
After making a selection, the item is then added to their order, which the customer can review the details of at any time before checking out. This provides instant visual confirmation of what was selected and ensures that items in the order are, in fact, what was intended.
This system also greatly lightens the load on the canteen’s end, as the entire process of taking orders is automated. Once an order is placed on the webpage, it is entered into thedatabase and then retrieved, in pretty much real-time, by a desktop application on the canteen’send. Within this application, all items in the order are displayed, along with their corresponding options and delivery details, in a concise and easy to read manner. This allows canteen employees to quickly go through the orders as they are placed and produce the necessary items with minimal delay and confusion.
